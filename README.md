# NorthumberlandBadmintonAdmin Application

## This is still very rough WIP

### The current Northumberland Badminton Admin Application is a legacy Apache Flex application which isn't great in 2022. This project is intended to replace that application. This is a Spring Boot/Kotlin/Thymeleaf application connecting to a basic rest service hosted on the Northumberland Badminton site, and uses some ideas and techniques I have been looking at recently.


## Pre-requisites

### JDK >= 11

## Development Focus

### The current admin application focuses on submission and approval of league matches and matches, and on player administration. Club and league administration was never added :-( Therefore the starting point for this application is to address this shortcoming.
